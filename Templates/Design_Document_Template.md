# Design Document

## Overview

This should be a brief summary of what the project will look like. An individual should get a general idea of what your work is just by looking at this section and should only need to look at other sections to get specific details. These parts should be included:

- Explanation of what the project does
- What the users will see
- How we will responded to user inputs

## Assumptions/Requirements

Here you write what the is in and out of scope for project

- What are the requirements you have to meet for it to be a completed project
- What are the constraints of the project
- What user information you will need
- Any assumptions that you had when you made design decisions

## Solution

This section details how you went about creating a solution for your project. This section should include high level flowchart and sequence diagram, solution description, use cases, and example request and responses between other services or other components of the overall product.

## Use case Diagram

## Failure considerations

Where are areas for possible failure and how will we deal with these errors, usually user based. Ex. if unable to reach server what will you show website users?

## Alternative Considerations

When deciding on what components, algorithms, and/or services used in your project, you should list out all the alternative options and have the pros and cons of each option to let readers know why you ended up on your final decisions. This section also allows you to quickly look back if there are issues with your current implementation to switch over to another option.

## Testing considerations

How You went about testing the project, and ensured that all components of your work is functional and there are failsafe put into place when a component does not work: This is an example of things to test for:

- Edge cases in algorithms
- Testing webpage on all browsers and devices
- Ensure that all links are functional
- Validate that user information is actually sent to server

## Operational considerations

This section section details how technical objectives succesfulness will be measured. Examples:

- Dashboards for latency to show that we are achieving less than X
- Dashboards to show error rate of speech to text translation

## Future Considerations

Any future improvements for the project that won't be included for the time being. Don't just put in a bunch of abstract ideas, you should add how you will go about implementing these new features given the time and resources. If a future consideration is added to the project scope you should adjust the entire document accordingly.
